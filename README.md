**DOS-ASM**
DOS-ASM is my self-created operating system made entirely in 8086 Assembly. Each of the files in the functions subdirectory contains subroutines that act as the drivers for this OS.

This is currently an early release and not intended to be a fully functioning OS yet

Currently, this OS does not have file system support but I aim to either implement FAT32 and/or my own file system in the future. Using a diskette image, the OS has the ability to install itself to a HDD using the BIOS Interrupt 0x13
